<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is a cryptanalysis tool for exploit developers and ctf players.

The name come from pwntools a similar tool to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities. This software aims to work like pwntools but for cryptanalysis.

Then this program include a library like pwnlib. And it will expose some command line tools. Like pwntools. This is a rewrite of the python version in rust in order to be able to be fast and portable and usable in the following various languages rust, python, ruby, javascript and kotlin together.

### Installation

Installation of `cryptatools-core` for rust is same for any OS. In `Cargo.toml`, just write:
```shell
[dependencies]
cryptatools-core = { git = "https://github.com/gogo2464/cryptatools-rs", package = 'cryptatools-core' }
```

To install the python Bindings,

If you are on windows, with powershell do:
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/gogo2464/cryptatools-rs ;
python .\cryptatools-core\setup.py bdist_wheel --verbose ;
$wheelFile = Get-ChildItem -Path .\dist\ -Recurse -Include * ;
pip3 install $wheelFile --force-reinstall ;
```

If you are on Linux, do:
```shell
python3 ./cryptatools-core/setup.py bdist_wheel --verbose ;
pip3 install ./dist/* --force-reinstall ;
```

If you are on MacOs, do:
```shell
python3 ./cryptatools-core/setup.py bdist_wheel --verbose ;
pip3 install ./dist/* --force-reinstall ;
```

<!-- TESTING EXAMPLES -->
## Testing

In order to run unit tests, you MUST be in the directory cryptatools-rs.
Run unit tests with doctests with the command:

```shell
cargo test --all
```

Unit test are made with doctests.

<!-- DOCUMENTATION EXAMPLE -->
## Documentation

The documentation is generated by doctstring with rustdoc. To edit the documentation, go to the code and modify the doctstring after `///`.

Then, in order to generate documentation from root folder do:

```shell
cargo doc
```

If you are a developper, fell free to view your own doc with

```
cargo doc --open
```

This project uses `cargo doc`.

The documentation is auto-generated at each pull request.

To see the cryptatools documentation. See: [the API documentation](https://gogo2464.github.io/cryptatools-rs/cryptatools_core/)

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

If you have a suggestion that would make this better, please fork the repo and create a pull request. You can also simply open an issue with the tag "enhancement".
Don't forget to give the project a star! Thanks again!

1. Document your work. See [the how to make documentation chapter](https://github.com/gogo2464/cryptatools#documentation)
2. For each method or object implemented, do not forget to make tests with doctest.
3. Create Python binding.
4. Open your Pull Request.

##Create Python bindings.

Cryptatools relies on uniffi to provide bindings to Python3. Ensure to provide Python3 bindings before making your Pull Request.

To create Python Bindings, edit the file `cryptatools-rs/src/cryptatools.udl`. Edit it to add your newly created object as mentionned in the official uniffi documentation at this address: https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/udl_file_spec.html.

Then do not forget to edit the file `cryptatools-rs/cryptatools-core/src/lib.rs` and just before the:

```
uniffi_macros::include_scaffolding!("cryptatools");
```

import your own crate.

Once this is done, edit the task `Test python bindings` on the pipeline of the file `cryptatools-rs/.github/workflows/windows.yml`. Fell free to import and use your work here.
