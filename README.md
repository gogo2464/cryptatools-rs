This is a cryptanalysis tool for exploit developers and ctf players.

The name come from pwntools a similar tool to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities. This software aims to work like pwntools but for cryptanalysis.

Then this program include a library like pwnlib. And it will expose some command line tools. Like pwntools. This is a rewrite of the python version in rust in order to be able to be fast and portable and usable in the following various languages rust, python, ruby, javascript and kotlin together.
